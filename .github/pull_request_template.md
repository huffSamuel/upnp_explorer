## What?
*Explain the changes you've made. It doesn't need to be fandy and you don't have to get technical.*

*Example:*
*I've added support for authentication. It includes model, table, controller, ant test. For more background, see #0*

## Why?
*Explain the goal this change achieves.*

*Example:*
*These changes complete the user login and account creation experience. See #0 for more information.*

## How?
*Draw attention to the significant design decisions of your changes. If you decided to write a recursive method instead of a loop, point out the merits of this to help reviewers understand your reasoning.*

*Example:*
This includes a migration, model, and controller for user authentication. I'm using a library to do the heavy lifting; migrations for the library are included here.*

## Testing?
*Indicate if this change includes tests. If any manual tests need to be performed, include steps for users to follow here.*

## Screenshots (optional)
*A simple screenshot of the before and after.*
*If your change isn't UI related, screenshots of .apk size, code layout, or other important information can help provide clarity to the result of the changes.*

## Anything Else?
*A space to call out potential architecture changes or technical debt. Call out challenges, optimizations, etc.*

*Example:*
*Let's consider using a 3rd party library to provide this feature so we can offload the technical details into a commonly used library that is well tested by the community.*
*Let's also consider breaking this out into its own library so we can re-use this code with other applications in the future.*
